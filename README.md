# sort_pix
Recursively re-organize files in a specified folder according to modification date into a series of contextually named sub-folders that are generated on the fly as needed. I primarily use this util for picture organization, but it will sort any file in the supplied path and doesn't ask for further confirmation before running, be careful!

## Usage
From the command line run:


  `python sort_pix.py <folder_path>`
